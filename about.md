I'm an art historian and freelance curator focusing on photography, publishing, and print design. I studied Art History at the [University of Lausanne](https://courtauld.ac.uk). I'm currently the Managing Assistant at [<cite>Transbordeur</cite>](https://transbordeur.ch/), SNSF Researcher at the [Center for History of Culture](https://unil.ch/microfilm), and Editorial Collaborator at the [Swiss Institute for Art Research](https://sik-isea.ch).
